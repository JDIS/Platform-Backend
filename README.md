# Platform - Backend
Backend part of the JDIS training platform.

See the [deploy repository](https://github.com/JDIS/Platform-Deploy) for details on how to deploy the platform.

## Run
The only requirement is that the `PWD` environment variable must be set to the directory of the project.
You can use `export PWD=$(pwd)` on unix-like platforms.

You can then run `npm start` to launch the server in `dev` mode.
